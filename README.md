# ObjDetection-Raspi-4
 Object detection implemented on a Raspberry Pi 4 with Transfer Learning using a Resnet18 model. This a simple tutorial to implement Custom Object Detection with Raspberry Pi 4 using Custom models and custom data with Pytorch, but also extendable to lighter models such as TFlite and ONNX for faster inference.
